## ðŸ§© STEP 1: CLONE THE FRONTEND REPOSITORY
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richiemaeomandam/reactNative_Frontend.git
cd reactNative_Frontend
```

---

## ðŸ“¦ STEP 2: INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

---

## ðŸ”— STEP 3: CONNECT TO THE BACKEND
Inside your React Native project, locate the file where the API URL is defined (usually `App.tsx` or `api.ts`).

Ensure the URL is set to:

```ts
const API_URL = 'https://reactnative-backend.onrender.com';
```

This connects your frontend to the deployed backend.

## ðŸŸ£ STEP 4: RUN THE REACT NATIVE APP

### âœ… Option 1: Using Expo
Run the following command to start the app with Expo:

```bash
npx expo start
```

A QR code will appear.

Scan it using the Expo Go app on your phone to launch the app.

### âœ… Option 2: Using React Native CLI
Make sure Android Studio is running (for emulator use).

For Android:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

For iOS (on Mac only):

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
